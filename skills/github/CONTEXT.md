# github — Catalog Context

Rules, notes, and references that apply only to skills in this catalog.
(Repo-wide standards live in `.agents/knowledge/skill-quality.md`.)

## Requirements

- **Design floor: a ~30B-parameter local model.** Every operation gets
  exactly one recommended path: the shared "Choose your path" procedure
  (GitHub MCP if its tools are visible in-session, else authenticated gh,
  else pair with `github-tooling-setup`), then decision tables mapping
  task → MCP tool → exact gh command. No unlabeled alternatives, no
  "you could also". Add a `Done when:` line where completion is ambiguous
  or a weak model may stop early or run past done; omit it for steps that
  are simple and cannot fail.
- Bodies stay well under 200 lines. Per-framework matrices, GraphQL
  queries, log recipes, template schemas, and the publish-review procedure
  live in `references/` behind precise load conditions. Deterministic
  multi-step logic (probes, label sync, log digestion) lives in `scripts/`
  (python3 ≥3.9 stdlib only, invoked with plain `python3`, non-interactive,
  exit codes 0/1/2, data to stdout, diagnostics to stderr, idempotent).
- Multi-line content is always sent via files (`--body-file`, or MCP body
  parameters filled from files), never inline shell strings.
- **Publishing safety.** Publishing = anything that becomes public: issue/
  PR/discussion titles and bodies, comments, labels, commit messages,
  diffs, attachments, branch names. Every skill that publishes embeds the
  canonical pre-publish gate in its body and ships its own copy of
  `references/publish-review.md` — the review procedure is never delegated
  to a separate skill that might not be loaded. Tailoring is allowed only
  where the canonical text marks it.
- Cross-skill overlap is limited to the canonical blocks below and the
  disambiguation line, duplicated verbatim where needed; deep content
  lives only in the owning skill. Sibling skills are named, never
  path-linked (self-containment).
- Exact MCP tool and gh command names — **and their parameter names,
  method enums, and value forms** — must be re-verified before publishing
  a skill revision. GitHub MCP tool names have churned across server
  versions (the 2025 consolidation replaced `get_issue`-style names with
  `*_read`/`*_write` + `method`), and README prose lags behind: the
  authoritative source for parameter shapes is the machine-generated
  schema snapshots at
  <https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server/tree/main/pkg/github/__toolsnaps__>
  (e.g. the README still said `submit` after the schema had moved to
  `submit_pending`).

## Canonical blocks

The following texts are canonical. Skills copy them verbatim; when editing
one, update every copy in the same commit (`grep -rl "Choose your path"
skills/github/` finds them).

### Choose your path

```markdown
## Choose your path (do this first, once per session)

1. Look at the tools available in this session. If any tool name contains
   `issue_read`, `pull_request_read`, or a `github` MCP server prefix (for
   example `mcp__github__...`), the GitHub MCP server is connected: use the
   **MCP** column of every table below.
2. Otherwise run `gh auth status`. If it exits 0, use the **gh** column.
3. Otherwise stop and tell the user GitHub tooling is not set up. This skill
   pairs with `github-tooling-setup`. If it is not installed, install it from
   https://github.com/ryan-minato/skills.git:

       npx skills add ryan-minato/skills --skill github-tooling-setup

4. Use one column for the whole task. Never mix MCP and gh in one operation.
```

#### Read-only variant (github-repo-research only)

`github-repo-research` inserts a REST-fallback step between steps 2 and 3
and renumbers accordingly; its closing step reads "Use one path for the
whole task. Never mix MCP, gh, and REST in one operation." The inserted
step is:

```markdown
3. Otherwise, if the target repository is public, or a token is set in
   `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` even though gh is missing, use the REST
   fallback: read [references/rest-fallback.md](references/rest-fallback.md)
   and run [scripts/rest_read.py](scripts/rest_read.py). Reads only.
```

### Pre-publish gate

The sentence in square brackets appears only in `github-pull-requests` and
the generated PR project-skill template (brackets removed there).

```markdown
## Pre-publish gate (mandatory)

Everything you send becomes public the moment the call succeeds: title, body,
every comment, labels, commit messages, the full diff, attachment contents,
and the branch name. [Creating a PR publishes every commit message and the
complete diff of `BASE...HEAD`, not just the description.] Before ANY call
that creates or edits public content:

1. Write the exact outgoing content to files in a scratch directory (title,
   body, each comment; for PRs also `git log BASE..HEAD --format=full >
   commits.txt` and `git diff BASE...HEAD > diff.patch`; copy attachments in).
2. Run the review procedure in references/publish-review.md over that
   directory. Read that file every time — do not review from memory.
3. Publish only after the verdict is exactly `SAFE TO PUBLISH: YES`. On `NO`,
   fix every finding, rebuild the files, review again. Never edit-and-publish
   without re-review.

Never publish unreviewed content. Only the user may skip this gate,
explicitly; record the skip in your summary.
Done when: a `SAFE TO PUBLISH: YES` verdict exists for the exact content
being sent.
```

### publish-review.md

The canonical copy of the full review procedure is
`github-issues/references/publish-review.md`; the copy in
`github-pull-requests` must be verbatim-identical. The generated
project-skill templates in the conventions skills embed a condensed version
of the same procedure.

## Disambiguation

Set up MCP/gh → `github-tooling-setup` · issue operations → `github-issues`
· PR operations → `github-pull-requests` · read-only repository research
(issues, PRs, Actions, Discussions — including repos without write access)
→ `github-repo-research` · authoring templates, labels, automation
→ `github-issue-conventions` / `github-pr-conventions`.

## Tool inventory

Maintenance index: every GitHub MCP tool and gh command the catalog's
skills reference, so upstream renames can be applied from here instead of
re-reading every skill. Whenever a skill adds, removes, or renames a tool
or command reference, update this inventory in the same commit.
